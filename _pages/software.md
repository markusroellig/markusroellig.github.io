Here I share some of the tools that I created during my research. Most of it is written in Mathematica by  [Wolfram Research](https://www.wolfram.com).

# WCSTools

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/WCSTools2)  a Mathematica package to display astronomical FITS images together with WCS coordinate grids.

# Escape Probability

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/EscapeProbability) extends the capabilities of Mathematica to solve the radiative transfer problem (in the astronomical context) using the escape probability approximation.

# HDF4Import

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/HDF4) a small Mathematica package to access Vdata sets in HDF4 data files.

# UMIST

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/UMIST) a Mathematica package to  process the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (UDfA) contents and create isotopic variants of the reaction equations and the corresponding rates.

# SpectrumPlot

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/SpectrumPlot)  a large Mathematica package to  access astronomical (spectroscopic) data from FITS files (various non-standard FITS variants are supported) and to further process the spectroscopic data.

# LTE

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/LTE) Local Thermal Equilibrium radiative transfer in Mathematica

# PDRica

[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/markusroellig/PDRica) A simple Mathematica PDR model code.

PDRs are Photon Dominated Regions in the interstellar medium. A PDR model computes the chemical and thermodynamical balance in these regions and their emission signature. PDRica is a port of the simple toy PDR model PyPDR written by Simon Bruderer [<i class="fas fa-code"></i>](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~simonbr/research_pypdr/). This is not meant to be a model for real world applications but to test certain numerical or physical aspects of PDR modelling in a very simple model setup.
