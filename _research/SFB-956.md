The central research topic of the CRC 956 is to advance our understanding of the complex interplay between star formation and its embedding interstellar medium (ISM). Through numerous dynamical and radiative feedback processes, this interaction drives the “Cosmic Cycle of Star Formation”, which in turn controls the global evolution of galaxies, the physical and chemical processes in the ISM, the distribution and properties of newly formed stars, and the formation of planetary systems, including the origin of life.

## Sub-Project area C1 - Modelling of Irradiated Molecular Clouds

Project C1 tries to understand the local chemistry and physics in photon-dominated regions (PDRs), these are molecular clouds affected by the UV radiation from young stars, by means of constructing a sophisticated PDR model that fits the observations of cooling lines and continuum radiation. The model includes all relevant chemical and microphysical processes and a flexible geometry adaptable to any star-forming region. It represents the main tool to interpret the line and continuum radiation from these regions that is typically observed at far-infrared and radio wavelengths. By iteratively improving the existing PDR model code and fitting observed data with the model output this project will help to understand all processes governing the structure and emission of the extended gas in star-forming regions.
