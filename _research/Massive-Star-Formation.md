## S 106

<img align="left" src="/images/research/s106_animated2.gif"/>
The massive star forming region S106 shows a
bipolar outflow with a complex velocity structure in its
emission. S106 is embedded in a large molecular
cloud and is partly obscured by a dark dusty
foreground lane possibly an extension of the small-scale
disk around S106-IR.
